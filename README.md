StoryLine transforms your Obsidian vault into a complete book planning and writing tool. Organize scenes, build characters, manage locations, track plotlines, and monitor your progress — all inside Obsidian.

---

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin and enable it in Obsidian settings.
2. Click the StoryLine ribbon icon  in the left sidebar to open the plugin.
3. You'll be prompted to create your first project — give it a name and start writing.

## Views

### Corkboard View

A freeform spatial canvas inside the Board view. Use sticky notes to brainstorm and capture your first ideas — then convert them into full scenes when they're ready. Notes are stored in a separate `Notes/` folder to keep your `Scenes/` folder clean; converting a note moves it to `Scenes/` automatically. Notes support markdown and can be styled with different colors. **Image sticky notes** let you pin reference art, maps, and charts directly on the board — drag images from the vault or desktop, add captions with `[[wikilinks]]`, and click to open a fullscreen lightbox. Pin scene cards and notes anywhere on the board and drag to rearrange. Toggle between the standard Kanban columns and corkboard mode with a single click. Positions are saved per project.

---

### Board View

Kanban-style scene cards organized by act, chapter, or status. Drag & drop scenes between columns. Color-coded by status, POV, emotion, or tag. Multi-select for bulk edits.

---

### Plotgrid View

Spreadsheet-style grid for mapping scenes against plotlines, themes, or story threads. Each cell can hold free text, formatting, colors, and linked scene cards. Double-click any cell to edit. Sticky headers keep row and column labels visible while scrolling.

Act and chapter divider bands show where story sections begin and end. Scene rows are color-coded by status. Click any row or column header to jump straight to the file. Uses the same shared filters as the Board and Timeline views. When a cell has a linked scene, the inspector shows a tabbed panel — edit cell notes or the full scene details without leaving the grid.

**Auto-Note** — When enabled (on by default), typing into an empty cell automatically creates a linked corkboard note. The note is tagged as an idea with a plotgrid origin label so you can trace it back to the row and column it came from. Toggle Auto-Note on or off from the toolbar.

**Codex Entity Tags** — Each cell automatically shows color-coded pills for characters, locations, and codex entries detected in the cell text or linked scene prose.

### Timeline View

Chronological scene timeline with visual markers for intensity, status, and duration. Supports swimlane grouping by act, chapter, POV, or location.

---

### Plotlines View

Track plotlines across your scenes with two view modes: a transit-style **subway map** (default) and a classic **list view**. The subway map uses flat SVG lanes with gradient connectors between shared scenes, act dividers, and scene labels with tag pills. Drag to pan large stories. Assign per-tag colors directly from the plotline header using the palette button or right-click context menu.

---

### Manuscript View

Scrivenings-style continuous document view. Every scene is rendered as an embedded Live Preview editor, ordered by act → chapter → sequence, so you can read and edit your entire story in one scrollable page without switching files.

Act and chapter dividers appear automatically between sections. Each scene block has a header with the scene title and a color-coded status badge. Click the title to open the file in a new tab. Supports the same shared filters as other views. A word count footer shows scene count and total words.

**Plain Text** — toggle on to hide wiki-link styling, tag prefixes, and external-link URLs so the text reads like clean prose.

**Lock Links** — toggle on to make internal links and tags non-editable. The cursor skips over link text, preventing accidental changes while you write around them.

Both toggles default to ON and appear in the filter bar.

**Focus Mode** — click the glasses icon to dim, darken, and blur surrounding UI so you can focus purely on writing. Configurable in Settings with sliders for dim, darken, and blur amounts.

### Characters View

Rich character profiles with collapsible sections: basic info, physical traits, personality, backstory, relationships, character arc, and custom fields. **Portrait images** — click to add a character image (import from computer or choose from vault). Portraits display on overview cards (64×64 px) and in the detail editor (96×96 px). **Image gallery** with carousel, captions, and a floating lightbox viewer. Includes a force-directed relationship map and a story graph showing how characters connect to scenes, locations, and props.

In version 1.5.0, Characters live inside the new **Codex** hub alongside Locations and any custom categories you create.

---

### Locations View

Hierarchical worldbuilding with worlds as top-level containers and locations nested underneath. Each location has fields for atmosphere, significance, and narrative role. **Portrait images** — add images to worlds and locations; thumbnails appear in the tree view and larger portraits in the detail editor. **Image gallery** with carousel, captions, and lightbox.

Locations are now part of the **Codex** hub in version 1.5.0.

---

### Navigator View

A compact sidebar panel for quick scene navigation. Search, sort, and filter your scenes without leaving your current view. Includes plotline filtering with color-coded dots and scene counts, five sort modes (sequence, status, recent, words, title), act grouping with collapsible sections, pinned scenes for quick access, and a progress bar. Opens automatically when a project loads (configurable) or via the command palette. A **Scene Details** button opens the Inspector sidebar for the active scene.

---

### Scene Details Sidebar

A standalone sidebar panel that displays the full Inspector for the currently active scene file. View and edit all scene metadata — title, status, POV, characters, location, tags, conflict, notes, and more — side-by-side with your writing. The panel auto-updates when you switch between files in the editor. Open it from the Navigator's **Scene Details** button or the command palette.

---

### Stats View

Statistics dashboard with eight collapsible sections: project overview with goal tracking and reading time estimate, writing sprint timer with daily goal and streak, writing history with daily bar charts (7d/30d/90d/All), progress breakdown by status/chapter/act, character & world coverage analysis with character × chapter heatmap, setup & payoff map with chain visualization, pacing & tension with dialogue ratio, tension curve, and pacing coach, prose analysis with readability scores and word frequency, echo finder for repeated phrases, and automated plot hole warnings.

## Key Features

## Project Structure

```
StoryLine/
  My Novel.md              ← Project file (Markdown + YAML frontmatter)
  My Novel/
    Scenes/                ← Scene files (Markdown + frontmatter)
    Codex/                 ← Codex hub folder
      Characters/          ← Character profiles (Markdown + frontmatter)
      Locations/           ← Location & world profiles (Markdown + frontmatter)
      [Custom]/            ← Any custom categories you add
    System/                ← Per-project settings (JSON, auto-managed)
    Exports/               ← Exported files
```

Series projects use a shared Codex at the series level:

```
StoryLine/
  My Series/
    series.json            ← Series manifest
    Codex/                 ← Shared Codex (Characters, Locations, custom)
    Book One.md
    Book One/
      Scenes/
      System/
```

All files are standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter. Edit them directly in Obsidian or through StoryLine's UI.

---

## Multiple Projects

Create, switch, and fork projects from the command palette. Each project gets its own folder structure. The last-used project is remembered across sessions.

---

## Series Mode

Group multiple book projects into a **series** with a shared Codex. Characters, locations, and custom categories are stored once at the series level and available in every book — no duplication.

- **Create Series** — Command palette → **Create Series from Current Project**, or **Settings → Project Management → Create Series**. Your book moves into a new series folder with a shared Codex.
- **Add to Series** — Command palette → **Add Current Project to Series**. Pick an existing series; your book and its Codex entries are migrated in.
- **Remove from Series** — Command palette → **Remove Current Project from Series**. The shared Codex is copied back into a local Codex and the book moves out.
- **Rename Book** — **Settings → Project Management → Rename book**. Renames the project file, folder, and updates frontmatter and series manifest.
- **Manage Series** — **Settings → Project Management → Manage Series**, or the "Manage Series…" button in the Open Project modal. View, rename, reorder, add, or remove books.

When a project belongs to a series, the project selector shows a series badge. All views (Characters, Locations, Codex) automatically use the shared series Codex — your workflow stays the same.

> **Required Obsidian setting:** Before creating or joining a series, make sure **Settings → Files & Links → "Automatically update internal links"** is turned **ON**. StoryLine checks this before migration and will block the operation if it's off — otherwise `[[wikilinks]]` would break when files move.

```
