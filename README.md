# StoryLine — Obsidian Plugin for Writers

**Version 1.5.0** · By Jan Sandström

2. Click the StoryLine ribbon icon  in the left sidebar to open the plugin.
3. You'll be prompted to create your first project — give it a name and start writing.

## Views

### Corkboard View

A freeform spatial canvas inside the Board view. Use sticky notes to brainstorm and capture your first ideas — then convert them into full scenes when they're ready. Notes support markdown and can be styled with different colors. Pin scene cards and notes anywhere on the board and drag to rearrange. Toggle between the standard Kanban columns and corkboard mode with a single click. Positions are saved per project.

### Board View

Kanban-style scene cards organized by act, chapter, or status. Drag & drop scenes between columns. Color-coded by status, POV, emotion, or tag. Multi-select for bulk edits.

---

### Plotgrid View

Spreadsheet-style grid for mapping scenes against plotlines, themes, or story threads. Each cell can hold free text, formatting, colors, and linked scene cards. Double-click any cell to edit. Sticky headers keep row and column labels visible while scrolling.

Act and chapter divider bands show where story sections begin and end. Scene rows are color-coded by status. Click any row or column header to jump straight to the file. Uses the same shared filters as the Board and Timeline views. When a cell has a linked scene, the inspector shows a tabbed panel — edit cell notes or the full scene details without leaving the grid.

**Auto-Note** — When enabled (on by default), typing into an empty cell automatically creates a linked corkboard note. The note is tagged as an idea with a plotgrid origin label so you can trace it back to the row and column it came from. Toggle Auto-Note on or off from the toolbar.

### Timeline View

Chronological scene timeline with visual markers for intensity, status, and duration. Supports swimlane grouping by act, chapter, POV, or location.

### Plotlines View

Track plotlines across your scenes with two view modes: a transit-style **subway map** (default) and a classic **list view**. The subway map uses flat SVG lanes with gradient connectors between shared scenes, act dividers, and scene labels with tag pills. Drag to pan large stories. Assign per-tag colors directly from the plotline header using the palette button or right-click context menu.

### Characters View

Rich character profiles with collapsible sections: basic info, physical traits, personality, backstory, relationships, character arc, and custom fields. **Portrait images** — click to add a character image (import from computer or choose from vault). Portraits display on overview cards (64×64 px) and in the detail editor (96×96 px). **Image gallery** with carousel, captions, and a floating lightbox viewer. Includes a force-directed relationship map and a story graph showing how characters connect to scenes, locations, and props.

In version 1.5.0, Characters live inside the new **Codex** hub alongside Locations and any custom categories you create.

### Locations View

Hierarchical worldbuilding with worlds as top-level containers and locations nested underneath. Each location has fields for atmosphere, significance, and narrative role. **Portrait images** — add images to worlds and locations; thumbnails appear in the tree view and larger portraits in the detail editor. **Image gallery** with carousel, captions, and lightbox.

Locations are now part of the **Codex** hub in version 1.5.0.

### Navigator View

A compact sidebar panel for quick scene navigation. Search, sort, and filter your scenes without leaving your current view. Includes plotline filtering with color-coded dots and scene counts, five sort modes (sequence, status, recent, words, title), act grouping with collapsible sections, pinned scenes for quick access, and a progress bar. Opens automatically when a project loads (configurable) or via the command palette.
