## Installation

### Manual Install

1. Copy these three files into your vault at `.obsidian/plugins/StoryLine/`:
   - `main.js`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css`
2. Open Obsidian → **Settings → Community Plugins** → enable **StoryLine**.
3. Restart Obsidian.

### From Source

1. Clone or download this repository into `.obsidian/plugins/StoryLine/`.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build`.
3. Enable the plugin in Obsidian settings.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Create a project** — Open the command palette (`Ctrl+P`) and run **StoryLine: Create New Project**. Give your project a title.
2. StoryLine creates a folder structure for you:
   ```
   StoryLine/
     My Novel/
       Scenes/
       Codex/
         Characters/
         Locations/
   ```
3. **Create your first scene** — Use `Ctrl+Shift+N` or click the **+** button in the Board view.
4. **Switch between views** using the tab bar at the top of any StoryLine view.

---

## Views

StoryLine provides seven interconnected views plus a sidebar navigator. Switch between them using the tab bar or keyboard shortcuts.

### Board View

The main workspace — a Kanban-style board that displays your scenes as cards.

- **Group by:** Act, Chapter, Status, or POV (use the dropdown in the toolbar).
- **Drag and drop** cards between columns to reassign act, chapter, status, or POV.
- **Color-coded cards** based on status, POV, emotion, act, or tag (configurable in settings).
- **Quick actions:** right-click any card for a context menu with edit, duplicate, delete, and open options.
- **Add acts/chapters** using the Structure and Chapters buttons in the toolbar.
- **Resequence** — click the resequence button to auto-number all scenes based on their current board order.
- **Search** — type in the search bar to filter scenes by title, content, characters, or tags.
- **Beat Sheet Templates** — apply a beat sheet template (Save the Cat, 3-Act, Hero's Journey) from the Structure modal.
- **Act labels** — custom labels on act dividers (e.g., beat names); inline-editable.

### Corkboard Mode

Toggle between the standard Kanban column layout and a freeform **corkboard** canvas using the toggle button in the Board toolbar.

- **Sticky notes** — create color-coded sticky notes to brainstorm and capture your first ideas. Notes support markdown formatting. Sticky notes are stored in a separate `Notes/` folder inside your project so they don't clutter the `Scenes/` folder in Obsidian's file explorer.
- **Image sticky notes** — pin reference art, maps, and charts on the board. Click **+ New Image Note** in the toolbar, or drag an image from the vault file explorer or your desktop onto the canvas. Each image note has an optional caption that supports markdown and `[[wikilinks]]` — links in captions are included in relationship scanning. Right-click an image note to set, change, or remove the image. Click the image to open a fullscreen lightbox.
- **Convert to scene** — when an idea is ready, convert a sticky note into a full scene with one click. The file is moved from `Notes/` to `Scenes/` automatically.
- **Freeform positioning** — drag scene cards and sticky notes anywhere on the spatial canvas.
- **Positions saved per project** — your corkboard layout is stored in `System/board.json` and syncs across devices.

### Plotgrid View

A spreadsheet-like grid for detailed scene planning.

- Rows and columns represent your story structure.
- Click any cell to edit its content, link a scene, set colors, or adjust metadata.
- **Zoom in/out** for overview or detail.
- Drag scenes onto cells to link them.
- Supports custom row/column headers for acts, chapters, plotlines, etc.
- **Act & chapter dividers** — colored bands appear when the act or chapter changes, showing labels from your project structure.
- **Status color-coding** — scene rows show a colored left border matching their current status.
- **Click to open** — click a row header to open the linked scene file. Click a column header to open the character or location file.
- **Shared filters** — the same filter bar used in Board and Timeline views is now available in the Plotgrid. Filter by status, act, chapter, POV, characters, locations, tags, or search text. Presets are shared across views.
- **Tabbed cell inspector** — when a cell has a linked scene, the inspector shows two tabs:
  - **Cell tab** — cell content, detected characters/locations/tags, and a linked scene link.
  - **Scene tab** — the full scene editor (status, POV, characters, location, tags, conflict, synopsis, etc.) so you can edit scene details without leaving the grid.
- **Auto-Note** — When the Auto-Note toggle is on (enabled by default), typing text into an empty, unlinked cell automatically creates a corkboard note and links it back to the cell. The note is saved as an *idea* with a `plotgridOrigin` label built from the row and column names, so you can always trace it back to where it started. Toggle Auto-Note on or off with the sticky-note icon in the Plotgrid toolbar — the icon turns accent-colored when active.
- **Codex entity tags** — Each cell automatically displays small color-coded pills at the bottom showing characters (blue), locations (green), and codex entries (purple) detected in the cell text and/or the linked scene's prose. Entity detection uses the same LinkScanner engine — no manual tagging needed.

### Timeline View

Visualize your scenes on a chronological timeline.

- Scenes are positioned by `storyDate` and `storyTime` metadata.
- Useful for tracking parallel storylines and temporal flow.
- Click a scene to edit its time properties.
- Supports multiple timelines for complex narratives.
- Add acts and chapters from the toolbar.
- **Order Toggle** — switch between **Reading Order** (scene sequence) and **Chronological Order** (in-story timeline). See [Reading Order vs Chronological Order](#reading-order-vs-chronological-order).
- **Dual-order badges** — each scene card shows both its reading-order number and chronological-order number.
- **Beat Sheet Templates** — apply a story structure template from the Structure modal.
- **Act labels** — custom beat/act labels are displayed on timeline dividers and are inline-editable.
- **Swimlane mode** — see [Timeline Swimlanes](#timeline-swimlanes).

### Plotlines View

Track your story's plotlines (tags) across the narrative. Two view modes are available — toggle between them with the buttons in the toolbar.

#### Subway Map (default)
- Transit-style SVG visualization with one flat lane per plotline.
- Scenes appear as labeled station nodes along each plotline's track.
- **Gradient connectors** link shared scenes across plotlines, colored by the source tag.
- **Act dividers** show vertical lines with act labels for structural context.
- **Scene labels & tag pills** display below each node for quick identification.
- **Drag to pan** — click and drag the map to navigate large stories.
- **Per-tag color picker** — click the palette (🎨) icon next to any plotline header to assign a custom color. Right-click a header for "Change color" / "Reset color".

#### List View
- Each plotline (tag) gets its own row showing which scenes it appears in.
- Quickly see which plotlines are active, dormant, or unresolved.

#### Common Features
- **Rename** or **delete** plotlines across all scenes at once.
- Visualize plotline density and coverage.
- Scenes default to **book order** (reading order). Toggle to sequence order from the toolbar.

### Manuscript View

A Scrivenings-style continuous document view that presents your entire story as a single scrollable manuscript. Each scene is an embedded Live Preview editor — you can read and edit everything in place without switching files.

- **Embedded editing** — every scene is a fully functional Obsidian Live Preview editor. Click into any scene and start typing.
- **Continuous reading** — scenes are arranged in reading order (act → chapter → sequence) with no frontmatter visible.
- **Act & chapter headings** — automatic section dividers appear whenever the act or chapter changes.
- **Scene dividers** — each scene block shows a subtle header with the scene title and a color-coded status badge (idea, draft, written, etc.).
- **Clickable titles** — click any scene title to open that scene file in a new tab.
- **Plain Text toggle** — hides wiki-link styling, tag `#` prefixes, and external-link URLs so the text reads like clean prose. Default: ON.
- **Lock Links toggle** — makes internal links and tags non-editable. The cursor skips over link and tag text, preventing accidental changes while you write around them. Default: ON.
- **Filter support** — use the same filter bar as other views to narrow down which scenes appear.
- **Word count footer** — total scene count and aggregate word count displayed at the bottom.
- **Lazy loading** — editors are mounted on demand as you scroll, keeping memory usage low even for large projects.
- **Navigator integration** — clicking a scene in the Navigator scrolls the manuscript to that scene instead of opening a new file.
- **Inspector tracking** — the Scene Details sidebar automatically follows whichever scene is currently visible in the manuscript.
- **Focus Mode** — click the glasses icon (👓) in the filter bar to enter Focus Mode. Surrounding UI (sidebars, ribbon, title bar, tab headers) is dimmed, darkened, and optionally blurred so you can concentrate on your text. The filter bar, scene headers, dividers, and footer are hidden. Adjust the effect in **Settings → Focus Mode Settings**: Dim amount (toolbar opacity), Darken (environment brightness), and Blur (environment blur). Click the glasses icon again to exit.

Access the Manuscript view from the **Manuscript** tab (📖 book-open-text icon) in the view switcher, located between Plotlines and Codex.

### Characters View

A dedicated character management system with rich profiles. Characters are accessed through the **Codex** hub.

#### Overview Grid
- All characters displayed as **compact cards** with role badge, snippet, and completeness bar.
- **Portrait images** — each card shows a circular portrait (64×64 px). Click the placeholder icon to add an image.

- **Image picker** — choose to import an image from your computer (saved into `<Project>/Images/`), pick an existing vault image, or remove the current image.
- All fields show grey **placeholder text** that disappears when you type.
- **Auto-save** — changes are saved automatically after a short delay (no manual save needed).
- **Side panel** shows:
  - Scene count, word count, and POV scene count.
  - Intensity curve graph for scenes featuring this character.
  - Gap detection warnings.
  - Full list of scenes the character appears in, with status badges.

### Locations View

A hierarchical worldbuilding and location management system. Locations are accessed through the **Codex** hub.

#### Two-Level Structure
- **Worlds** — top-level containers for worldbuilding (geography, culture, politics, magic/technology, beliefs, economy, history).
- **Locations** — specific places that can optionally belong to a world. Locations can also have a **parent location**, enabling unlimited nesting (e.g., a building → its rooms).

#### Overview Tree
- Worlds appear as **collapsible top-level nodes** with a globe icon and location count.
- **Image thumbnails** — small (20×20 px) thumbnails appear next to each node when an image is set.
- Locations nest underneath their world, with further child locations indented below their parent.
- **Standalone locations** (not linked to any world) appear in a separate section.
- **Unlinked locations** — places referenced in scenes but without a profile show a "Create" button.
- Click any node to open its detail editor.

#### Detail Editor
- **World profiles** have eight collapsible sections: Overview, Geography & Environment, Culture & Society, Politics & Power, Magic & Technology, Beliefs & Mythology, Economy & Trade, History & Lore.
- **Location profiles** have five sections: Overview, Atmosphere & Description, Story Significance, Connected Locations, and a Hierarchy section with World and Parent dropdowns.
- **Portrait area** — rectangular portrait (120×80 px) at the top of the detail editor. Click to add or change the image.
- **Image gallery** — add up to 10 images with captions. Browse via carousel or open in a floating lightbox. See [Image Galleries](#image-galleries).

- **Auto-save** with focus-loss protection (editing won't be interrupted).
- **Side panel** shows:
  - Location/world stats (scene count, sub-location count).
  - List of scenes set at the location.
  - Characters who appear at the location (with frequency count).
  - For worlds: all locations in that world with one-click navigation.
  - **Referenced By** — other entities and scenes that mention this location (see [Cross-Entity References](#cross-entity-references)).
- **Hide/show fields** — hover over any field label to reveal an eye icon. Click to hide unused fields. See [Hide / Show Built-in Fields](#hide--show-built-in-fields).

### Codex Hub

The Codex is a unified hub that brings Characters, Locations, and custom categories together in one place.

- **Tab navigation** — Switch between Characters, Locations, and any custom categories using the tab bar at the top of the Codex.
- **Custom categories** — Add your own categories (for example: Props, Factions, Magic Systems, Creatures) from the Codex toolbar. Each category gets its own folder inside `Codex/`, its own search, and individual detail pages with editable fields.
- **Search** — A search bar at the top of the hub filters across all entries, including Characters and Locations.
- **Back navigation** — From any detail page, click the back arrow to return to the Codex hub.
- **Change detection** — When a codex entry's content has been modified since it was last reviewed, an amber warning banner appears on the detail page listing all scenes that reference the entry. Click any scene name to open it. Click **"Mark as reviewed"** to clear the warning and update the stored digest. Digests are stored per-project in `System/codex-digests.json`.
- **Backward compatible** — Existing projects that have Characters and Locations folders at the top level (outside Codex/) continue to work without any changes.

### Stats View

A statistics dashboard organized into eight collapsible sections. Click any section header to expand or collapse it.

#### 1. Overview (open by default)
- **Word count progress** — actual vs. project goal with a progress bar.

### Scene Details Sidebar

A standalone sidebar panel that shows the full Inspector for the currently active scene file. Use it to view and edit scene metadata side-by-side with your writing.

#### How It Works

1. Open the Scene Details Sidebar from the **Scene Details** button in the Navigator, or via the command palette (**Open Scene Details Sidebar**).
2. The panel automatically detects the active file in the editor.
3. If the active file is a scene (has `type: scene` in frontmatter), the full Inspector is displayed — title, status, POV, characters, location, tags, conflict, notes, setup/payoff links, and more.
4. When you switch to a different file, the panel updates automatically.
5. If the active file is not a scene, an empty state message is shown.

#### Features

- **Auto-update** — follows the active editor file. Switch between scene files and the sidebar updates instantly.
- **Full Inspector** — all the same fields and editing capabilities as the main Inspector panel.
- **Refresh on save** — when you modify a scene file in the editor, the sidebar refreshes to reflect changes (with a short delay to avoid conflicts).
- **Non-intrusive** — lives in the right sidebar and doesn’t interfere with your main views.

### Research Sidebar

A right-sidebar panel for collecting and browsing research material alongside your writing. Research posts are stored as Markdown files in the `Research/` folder inside your project.

#### Post Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Note** | Free-form research notes |
| **Web Clip** | Content clipped from the web, with source URL |
| **Image** | Image-based reference material |
| **Question** | Open questions that need answering, with resolved/unresolved tracking |

#### Features

- **Search** - type in the search box to filter posts by title, body text, and tags.
- **Tag filter** - click any tag chip to filter results to that tag. Click again to clear.
- **Type filter** - filter by post type (Note, Web Clip, Image, Question) or show all.
- **Auto-suggest** - click the sparkle button to switch to auto-suggest mode. The panel surfaces research posts relevant to the active scene's characters, location, and tags.
- **Open question badge** - shows a red badge with the count of unresolved questions.
- **Inline detail** - click a card to expand it and read the full content, source URL, and action buttons.
- **Create** - click the + button to create a new research post with title, type, tags, optional source URL, and content.
- **Open / Resolve / Delete** - expanded cards include buttons to open the file in the editor, toggle question resolved status, or delete the post.

#### How to Open

Use the command palette: **Open Research Sidebar**.

| `intensity` | Arc intensity (-10 to +10) | `7` |
| `wordcount` | Actual word count (auto) | `1200` |
| `target_wordcount` | Target word count | `800` |
| `tags` | Plotlines and themes | `["romance", "betrayal"]` |
| `notes` | Editorial / author notes | `"Needs more tension"` || `timeline_mode` | Non-linear narrative technique | `"flashback"` |
| `timeline_strand` | Parallel/frame strand group | `"1985"` |
| `subtitle` | Optional subtitle below the title | `"Three years later"` |
| `setup_scenes` | Scenes this sets up | `["path/to/scene.md"]` |
| `payoff_scenes` | Scenes that pay off this one | `["path/to/scene.md"]` |

**Status progression:** `idea` → `outlined` → `draft` → `written` → `revised` → `final`

Write your scene content below the frontmatter as normal Markdown.

---

## Scene Subtitles

Scenes can have an optional **subtitle** field — a short phrase displayed below the title. Use it for things like:

- *"Three years later"*
- *"Meanwhile, in Paris"*
- *"Interlude: Letters from the front"*

Subtitles appear on scene cards (Board view) and in the Manuscript view header. Edit them in the Inspector panel just below the title input.

Set the `subtitle` field in frontmatter, or type it directly in the Inspector. Leave it blank to hide.

---

## Scene Archive

Archive a scene to remove it from all views without deleting it. Archived scenes are moved to the `Archive/` folder inside your project.

- **Archive** — right-click any scene in the Board or Navigator and choose **Archive Scene**. The file moves to `Archive/` and disappears from the index.
- **Restore** — click the **archive button** (📦) in the Board view toolbar. This opens a modal listing all archived scenes, each with a **Restore** button that moves the file back to `Scenes/` and re-indexes it.
- **Forking** — when you fork a project, archived scenes are copied to the new project's `Archive/` folder.

Archived scenes stay as regular `.md` files and can be reviewed or edited at any time through Obsidian's file explorer.

---

## Inspector Panel

Click any scene card to open the **Inspector Panel** on the right side. It provides:

- **Metadata editing** — title, act, chapter, sequence, status, POV, location, conflict, emotion, intensity.
- **Characters** — add/remove characters with autocomplete and tag-pill inputs.
- **Tags** — manage plotline tags with autocomplete, color-coded tag badges when tag colors are configured.
- **Notes** — editorial notes field for author comments and reminders.
- **Snapshots** — save and restore point-in-time versions of the scene.
- **Word count** — current vs. target with progress indicator.
- **Setup/Payoff links** — see and manage which scenes set up or pay off this scene.
- **Time & Order** — story date, story time, chronological order, timeline mode, and timeline strand (see [Reading Order vs Chronological Order](#reading-order-vs-chronological-order) and [Timeline Modes](#timeline-modes)).
- **Open scene** — click to open the full Markdown file in reading view (frontmatter stays hidden).

---

## Filtering & Presets

All views support filtering by:

- **Status** (idea, outlined, draft, written, revised, final)
- **Characters** — filter by character presence
- **Locations** — filter by location
- **Tags** — filter by plotline/theme tags
- **Search text** — free-text search across titles and content

### Filter Chips

Active filters appear as clickable chips at the top. Click a chip to remove that filter.

### Saved Presets

Save your current filter combination as a **preset** for quick reuse:

1. Set your desired filters.
2. Click **Save Preset** and give it a name.
3. Access saved presets from the preset dropdown.
4. Delete presets you no longer need.

---

## Multi-Select & Bulk Edit

In the **Board View**, hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) and click multiple scene cards to select them. A **bulk action bar** appears with:

- **Set Status** — change status for all selected scenes.
- **Move to Act** — reassign act for all selected scenes.
- **Add Tag** — add a tag to all selected scenes.
- **Delete** — trash all selected scenes (with confirmation).
- **Clear** — deselect all.

---

## Setup / Payoff Tracking

Link scenes that set up (foreshadow) and pay off (resolve) each other:

1. Open a scene in the **Inspector Panel**.
2. Scroll to the **Setup / Payoff** section.
3. Click **+ Add** to link a target scene using the scene picker.
4. Links are bidirectional — if Scene A "sets up" Scene B, Scene B shows Scene A under "Set up by".

The Stats View and Plot Hole Detection will warn about:
- Setups without payoffs.
- Payoffs without setups.
- Setups that appear *after* their payoff (ordering issues).

---

## Plot Hole Detection

StoryLine's **Validator** engine automatically scans your story for potential issues. Enable it in Settings (`enablePlotHoleDetection`). Warnings appear in the **Stats View**, grouped into six categories:

### 1. Timeline
- Duplicate sequence numbers.
- Large sequence gaps (>5 missing numbers) — skipped for `timeskip`, `dream`, and `mythic` modes.
- Story dates out of chronological order — skipped for `flashback`, `flash_forward`, `dream`, `mythic`, and `circular` modes.
- Parallel/frame strand scenes are validated independently within each strand group.

### 2. Characters
- Scenes missing a POV character.
- Characters that only appear once (potential orphans).
- Characters that disappear for more than 40% of the story.

### 3. Plotlines
- Tags/plotlines that appear in early acts but vanish before the end.
- Plotlines missing from middle acts.
- Scenes with no tags at all.

### 4. Setup / Payoff
- Setups that reference non-existent scenes.
- Missing reverse links (one-directional connections).
- Setup scenes that appear *after* their payoff scene.

### 5. Structure
- Untitled scenes.
- Scenes without an act assignment.
- Severe act imbalance (one act 3× larger than another).
- Scenes with no conflict defined.

### 6. Continuity & Pacing
- Sharp intensity drops (≥6 points between consecutive scenes) — skipped when `dream` or `mythic` scenes are involved.
- Monotonous emotion streaks (5+ consecutive scenes with the same emotion) — streaks reset at `dream`/`mythic` boundaries.

Each warning has a **severity level**:
- 🔴 **Error** — likely a real problem.
- 🟡 **Warning** — worth investigating.
- ℹ️ **Info** — minor suggestion.

---

## Undo / Redo

StoryLine tracks changes to scenes (create, update, delete) and lets you undo/redo:

- **Undo:** `Ctrl+Z` (or command palette: *Undo Last Scene Change*)
- **Redo:** `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (or command palette: *Redo Last Scene Change*)

The undo stack stores up to 50 actions and persists within the current session.

---

## Reading Order vs Chronological Order

For non-linear narratives (flashbacks, time jumps, in medias res), StoryLine supports two separate ordering fields:

- **Reading Order** (`sequence`) — the order scenes appear when the reader reads the book, page by page.
- **Chronological Order** (`chronologicalOrder`) — the order events happen within the story's timeline.

### How to Use

1. **Set chronological order** in the Inspector's **Time & Order** modal, or directly in the scene's YAML frontmatter.
2. **Switch order in Timeline View** — use the order dropdown in the toolbar to toggle between "Reading Order" and "Chronological Order".
3. **Dual-order badges** appear on scene cards showing both numbers (e.g., `R:5 / C:2` means reading order 5, chronological order 2).
4. **Drag-and-drop** in the Timeline respects the currently active order mode.

### Export

Both `sequence` and `chronologicalOrder` are included in all export formats (Markdown, JSON, CSV, PDF).

---

## Beat Sheet Templates

Apply proven story structure templates to quickly scaffold your acts:

### Built-in Templates

| Template | Beats | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Save the Cat!** | 15 beats | Blake Snyder's popular screenplay structure (Opening Image, Theme Stated, Set-Up, Catalyst, Debate, Break into Two, B Story, Fun & Games, Midpoint, Bad Guys Close In, All Is Lost, Dark Night of the Soul, Break into Three, Finale, Final Image) |
| **Three-Act Structure** | 10 beats | Classic three-act framework (Hook, Inciting Incident, First Plot Point, Rising Action, Midpoint, Complications, Crisis, Climax, Falling Action, Resolution) |
| **Hero's Journey** | 12 stages | Joseph Campbell's monomyth (Ordinary World, Call to Adventure, Refusal of the Call, Meeting the Mentor, Crossing the Threshold, Tests Allies Enemies, Approach to the Inmost Cave, The Ordeal, Reward, The Road Back, Resurrection, Return with the Elixir) |

### How to Use

1. Open the **Structure** modal from the Board or Timeline toolbar.
2. Select a **Beat Sheet Template** from the dropdown.
3. Click **Apply** — StoryLine creates the acts and assigns beat labels automatically.
4. **Act labels** appear on column headers (Board View) and timeline dividers (Timeline View).
5. **Edit labels inline** by clicking the label text on any act divider.

Beat names are stored as `actLabels` on the project and persist across sessions.

---

## Scene Notes

Each scene has an optional **notes** field for editorial comments, reminders, and revision notes:

- Edit notes in the **Inspector Panel** under the Notes section.
- Notes are separate from the scene body — they're for author-facing comments that won't appear in the manuscript.
- Notes are included in **outline exports** (Markdown, JSON, CSV) so you can share them with editors.

---

## Scene Snapshots

Save point-in-time snapshots of a scene for version tracking:

- **Save Snapshot** — captures the current state of a scene (frontmatter + body).
- **View Snapshots** — browse previous snapshots with timestamps.
- **Restore** — revert a scene to any previous snapshot.

Useful for experimenting with rewrites without losing your earlier work.

---

## View Snapshots

Save and restore point-in-time snapshots of your entire project's **view layout** — corkboard positions, Plot Grid state, and scene ordering — without affecting scene content.

### What a snapshot captures
- **Corkboard layout** — card x/y positions and individual card heights.
- **Plot Grid state** — rows, columns, cells, zoom level, styling, and linked scenes.
- **Scene layout metadata** — act, chapter, status, POV, and sequence numbers.

### How to use
1. Click the **clock icon** (🕓) in the Board or Plotgrid toolbar, or run **Manage View Snapshots** from the command palette.
2. Click **+** to create a new snapshot. It becomes the active snapshot immediately.
3. Rearrange your corkboard, edit the Plot Grid, or reorder scenes — changes are **auto-saved** back to the active snapshot after a 2-second pause.
4. To compare different layouts, load a different snapshot from the list.
5. Rename or delete snapshots from the same modal.

### Key details
- **Free-editing mode** — when no snapshot is active, changes are saved normally without snapshot tracking.
- **Per-project** — each project has its own snapshot history, stored in `System/Snapshots/`.
- **Layout only** — snapshots do not capture scene prose or frontmatter content. Use **Scene Snapshots** for that.

---

## Scene Templates

Create reusable templates for common scene types:

### Built-in Templates
- Starter templates for common scene patterns.

### Custom Templates
1. Set up a scene with your desired default values (status, act, tags, conflict patterns, etc.).
2. Save it as a template from the scene context menu.
3. When creating new scenes, choose a template to pre-fill fields.

Templates are stored in settings and available across all projects.

---

## Color Coding & Tag Colors

StoryLine color-codes scene cards across all views. Choose a mode in **Settings → Color Coding**:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Status** | Colors based on scene status (idea, draft, final, etc.) |
| **POV** | Each POV character gets a unique color |
| **Emotion** | Colors mapped to emotional tones |
| **Act** | Each act gets a distinct color |
| **Tag** | Cards colored by their first tag's assigned color |

### Color Schemes

StoryLine ships with **16 built-in color schemes** plus a fully custom option:

| Group | Schemes |
|-------|----------|
| **Catppuccin** | Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha |
| **Moods** | Spring, Morning, Summer, Dusk, Midnight, Autumn, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Arctic, Vintage, Neon |
| **Custom** | Define your own palette in settings |

Each scheme provides 14 colors that are automatically assigned to tags. Select a scheme in **Settings → Color Coding** — schemes are displayed as compact cards grouped by family, with a color preview strip and a mood hint.

### Per-Tag Color Overrides

Override individual tag colors without changing the whole scheme:

- **From the Plotlines view** — click the palette (🎨) icon next to any plotline header, or right-click and choose "Change color" / "Reset color".
- **From Settings** — in the Color Coding section, each tag appears as a compact chip with a color swatch. Click the swatch to pick a custom color; click the × to reset.

Overrides persist across sessions and take priority over the active scheme.

All color coding is **theme-aware** — colors automatically adapt to your current Obsidian theme (dark or light mode).

---

## Plotline HSL Sliders

Fine-tune your plotline color palette without switching schemes. In **Settings → Plotline Color Scheme**, three sliders let you adjust the entire palette at once:

| Slider | Range | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Hue Shift** | −180 … +180 | Rotates all palette colors around the color wheel |
| **Saturation** | −100 … +100 | Makes colors more vivid (positive) or muted (negative) |
| **Lightness** | −100 … +100 | Makes colors lighter (positive) or darker (negative) |

Changes apply in real time with a live swatch preview. The adjustments stack on top of the active color scheme and per-tag overrides.

---

## Sticky Note Themes

Corkboard sticky notes have their own independent color system. Choose a theme in **Settings → Sticky Note Colors**:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Classic** | Warm yellows, pinks, greens, and blues |
| **Pastel** | Soft, low-saturation tones |
| **Earth** | Warm browns, olive, terracotta, and sage |
| **Jewel** | Rich, saturated gemstone colors |
| **Neon** | Bright, high-energy fluorescent tones |
| **Mono** | Greyscale neutrals |

Each theme provides 14 colors. Like plotline colors, sticky notes also have **HSL sliders** (hue shift, saturation, lightness) for fine-tuning and **per-note color overrides** — right-click a sticky note to assign a specific color.

---

## Per-Project Color Overrides

By default, color scheme, HSL adjustments, and sticky note theme are global settings shared across all projects. You can optionally save them per project so each book has its own look.

### Enabling

1. Open **Settings → Plotline Color Scheme**.
2. Toggle **Use project-specific colors** (visible only when a project is loaded).
3. Any changes you make to the color scheme, HSL sliders, or sticky note theme will now be saved into the active project's `System/plotlines.json` file.

### Behavior

- **Toggle ON** — color settings are stored in the project and override the global defaults whenever that project is active.
- **Toggle OFF** — removes per-project overrides and restores the global color settings.
- **Switching projects** — when you open a project with per-project colors, those colors load automatically. When you open a project without them, the global defaults are restored.

This is useful when you want a dark moody palette for a thriller and bright pastels for a romance, without manually switching schemes every time you change projects.

---

## Timeline Swimlanes

The Timeline View supports a **Swimlane Mode** that organizes scenes into vertical columns:

### Enabling Swimlanes

1. Open the **Timeline View**.
2. Click the **Swimlanes** toggle button in the toolbar.
3. Choose a grouping from the **Group By** dropdown:

| Group By | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **POV** | One swimlane column per POV character |
| **Location** | One swimlane per location |
| **Tag** | One swimlane per tag/plotline |

### How It Works

- Scenes are placed in a **CSS grid** layout with swimlane columns.
- Each column has a **header** showing the group name and scene count.
- Scenes without a value for the grouping field appear in an "Ungrouped" column.
- Swimlanes combine with the reading/chronological order toggle — scenes are sorted within each column by the active order.

This is especially useful for visualizing parallel storylines, tracking character arcs across locations, or analyzing plotline distribution.

---

## Timeline Modes

For stories with non-linear narratives, each scene can declare a **timeline mode** that describes its temporal relationship to the main narrative. This prevents false plot-hole warnings and provides visual indicators throughout the UI.

### Available Modes

| Mode | YAML Value | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Linear | `linear` | Default — scene follows the normal timeline |
| Flashback | `flashback` | Scene depicts past events |
| Flash Forward | `flash_forward` | Scene depicts future events |
| Parallel | `parallel` | Scene runs on a separate parallel timeline |
| Frame | `frame` | Scene is part of a framing narrative |
| Simultaneous | `simultaneous` | Scene happens at the same time as the previous |
| Time Skip | `timeskip` | Scene jumps forward, skipping elapsed time |
| Dream | `dream` | Dream sequence, vision, or hallucination |
| Mythic | `mythic` | Myth, legend, story-within-a-story |
| Circular | `circular` | Scene echoes or returns to an earlier moment |

### Setting Timeline Mode

1. **Inspector** — open the scene's **Time & Order** modal and select a mode from the dropdown.
2. **YAML frontmatter** — set `timeline_mode: flashback` (or any value above) directly in the file.
3. **Timeline strand** — for `parallel` and `frame` modes, set `timeline_strand` to group related scenes (e.g., `timeline_strand: "1985"`).

### How Modes Affect Validation

- **Date order checks** are skipped for flashback, flash_forward, dream, mythic, and circular scenes.
- **Gap checks** are skipped for timeskip, dream, and mythic scenes.
- **Intensity drop warnings** are skipped when dream or mythic scenes are involved.
- **Emotion streak detection** resets at dream/mythic boundaries.
- **Parallel/frame strands** are validated independently — each strand group must have internally consistent dates.
- **Simultaneous scenes** are allowed to share the same date as adjacent scenes.

### Visual Indicators

- **Color-coded badges** appear on scene cards (Board View), timeline entries, swimlane cards, and the Inspector.
- Each mode has a distinct color (e.g., flashback = purple, parallel = blue, dream = violet, mythic = gold).
- Strand labels are shown alongside mode badges for parallel/frame scenes.
- All 10 modes are included in exports (Markdown, JSON, CSV, PDF).

### Narrative Techniques Covered

These 10 modes cover all common non-linear structures:

| Technique | Recommended Mode |
|-----------|------------------|
| Flashback / analepsis | `flashback` |
| Flash-forward / prolepsis | `flash_forward` |
| Parallel timelines | `parallel` + `timeline_strand` |
| Frame story / nested narrative | `frame` + `timeline_strand` |
| Simultaneous action | `simultaneous` |
| Time skip / ellipsis | `timeskip` |
| Dream / vision / hallucination | `dream` |
| Myth / legend / story-within-story | `mythic` |
| Circular narrative | `circular` |
| In medias res | `flashback` for backstory scenes |
| Retrospective narration | `frame` for narrator frame |
| Epistolary non-linearity | `parallel` with letter/diary strands |
| Subjective time distortion | `dream` |

---

## Pacing Analysis

The **Stats View** includes a Pacing Analysis panel with two visualizations:

### Average Scene Length by Act
- A **bar chart** showing the average word count of scenes in each act.
- Helps identify acts that may be too sparse or too dense.
- Acts use their custom beat labels if a beat sheet template has been applied.

### Word Count Distribution
- A **histogram** showing how scene word counts are distributed across your project.
- Bin ranges (e.g., 0–500, 500–1000, …) are automatically calculated.
- Helps identify if your scenes are consistently sized or if you have outliers.

---

## Writing Sprint

StoryLine includes a built-in writing sprint timer in the **Stats View**:

1. Set your desired sprint duration.
2. Click **Start** to begin the countdown.
3. Write in your scene files — the timer runs in the Stats panel.
4. When the timer ends, your sprint session is recorded.

Use sprints to stay focused and build a consistent writing habit.

---

## Relationship Map

The **Characters View** includes a visual relationship map:

- Displays characters as nodes connected by relationship lines.
- **Six relationship types**, each with a distinct color and line style:

| Type | Color | Line Style |
|------|-------|------------|
| Ally | Green | Solid |
| Enemy | Red | Dashed |
| Romantic | Pink | Dotted |
| Family | Orange | Solid |
| Mentor | Purple | Dash-dot |
| Other | Grey | Dashed |

- Click a character node to navigate to their profile.
- **Zoom** — scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in/out (cursor-centered).
- **Pan** — click and drag the background to pan the view.
- Helps visualize complex webs of character relationships at a glance.

### Character Relationship Fields

Relationships are populated from the character profile editor:

| Field | Description | Stored As |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Allies & Friends** | Trusted companions | `allies: ["Name", ...]` |
| **Enemies & Rivals** | Opponents and conflicts | `enemies: ["Name", ...]` |
| **Romantic** | Love interests, partners, exes | `romantic: ["Name", ...]` |
| **Mentors** | Teachers, guides, role models | `mentors: ["Name", ...]` |
| **Other Connections** | Any other notable relationships | `otherRelations: ["Name", ...]` |
| **Family** | Parsed from the Family free-text field | `family: "free text"` |

---

## Story Graph

The **Characters View** includes a **Story Graph** (third tab alongside Overview and Relationship Map).

The Story Graph is an interactive force-directed SVG visualization showing how scenes, characters, locations, and props are interconnected:

### Node Types

| Node | Shape | Color | Source |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Scene | Rectangle | Purple | Scenes with detected `[[wikilinks]]` |
| Character | Circle | Blue | Characters referenced via wikilinks |
| Location | Diamond | Green | Locations referenced via wikilinks or character fields |
| Prop | Hexagon | Pink | `#hashtags` in character text fields |
| Other | Small circle | Orange | Unclassified wikilink targets |

### Edge Types

Edges represent three categories of connections:

1. **Scene ↔ Entity** — a scene references a character, location, or entity via `[[wikilink]]` in its body text.
2. **Character ↔ Character** — relationship edges (ally, enemy, romantic, family, mentor, other) from character profiles.
3. **Character → Prop** — `#hashtags` found in character text fields (appearance, props, habits, etc.).
4. **Character → Location** — from the `locations` field or `#tags` in the residency field.

### Filter Toggles

The toolbar provides entity-type filter buttons:

- **Characters** — show/hide character nodes
- **Locations** — show/hide location nodes
- **Other** — show/hide unclassified nodes
- **Props** — show/hide prop hexagons
- **Relationships** — show/hide character-to-character relationship edges

### Interaction

- **Drag nodes** — click and drag any node to reposition it.
- **Zoom** — scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in/out (cursor-centered).
- **Pan** — click and drag the background to pan the view.
- **Click a scene node** — fires the scene select callback.
- **Legend** — a color legend shows all node types and relationship edge colors.

### How Links Are Detected

The Story Graph uses the **Link Scanner** to find connections. See [Link Scanner & Detected Links](#link-scanner--detected-links).

---

## Link Scanner & Detected Links

StoryLine includes a **Link Scanner** that automatically extracts `[[wikilinks]]` from your scene body text and classifies them:

### How It Works

1. The scanner extracts all `[[wikilinks]]` from each scene's Markdown body (below the frontmatter).
2. Each link is classified against your project's characters, locations, and codex entries:
   - If the link matches a character name or nickname → **character**
   - If the link matches a location name → **location**
   - If the link matches a codex entry name → **codex** (with its category)
   - Otherwise → **other** (unclassified)

### Where Links Appear

- **Inspector Panel** — a "Detected Links" section shows all wikilinks found in the selected scene, displayed as typed pills (character / location / codex / other).
- **Story Graph** — detected links drive the scene-to-entity edges in the graph visualization.
- **Referenced By panel** — cross-entity references are shown on every character, location, and codex detail page (see [Cross-Entity References](#cross-entity-references)).

### Usage Tips

- Write `[[Character Name]]`, `[[Location Name]]`, or `[[Codex Entry]]` naturally in your scene prose or in any entity text field.
- The scanner runs automatically — no manual tagging required.
- Links that don't match any known entity appear as "other" — you can override their type via the context menu (see [Tag Type Overrides](#tag-type-overrides)).

---

## Cross-Entity References

StoryLine now tracks **cross-entity references** across your entire project. When you mention a character in a location description, or reference a location in a codex entry, StoryLine detects the connection and displays it in a **"Referenced By"** panel on the entity's side panel.

### How It Works

1. Write `[[Character Name]]`, `[[Location Name]]`, or `[[Codex Entry]]` in any text field — scene prose, character backstory, location descriptions, codex entry fields, etc.
2. Use `#tags` that match entity names (e.g., `#MagicSword` will reference a codex entry named "MagicSword").
3. Plain-text name mentions (without brackets or #) are also detected automatically.
4. StoryLine scans all entities and scenes and builds a reverse reference index.
5. Open any character, location, or codex detail page — the side panel shows a **"Referenced By"** section listing every entity and scene that mentions it.

### What Gets Scanned

| Source | Fields scanned |
|---|---|
| **Characters** | Backstory, appearance, personality, motivations, strengths, flaws, fears, belief, misbelief, notes |
| **Locations** | Description, atmosphere, significance, inhabitants, connected locations, map notes, notes |
| **Worlds** | Description, geography, culture, politics, magic/technology, beliefs, economy, history, notes |
| **Codex entries** | All text fields |
| **Scenes** | Full body text (wikilinks and plain-text matches) |

### Reference Display

References are grouped by type:
- **Character** — other characters that mention this entity
- **Location** — locations or worlds that mention it
- **Codex category name** (e.g., "Items", "Creatures") — codex entries that mention it
- **Scene** — scenes that contain a wikilink or name match

Each reference is a clickable link that opens the source file.

### Tips

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` or `#tags` for guaranteed detection — plain-text matching depends on exact name matches.
- `#tags` are matched case-insensitively: `#magicsword` will match a codex entry named "MagicSword".
- The scanner updates every time you open an entity detail page, so new connections appear immediately.
- Self-references are excluded (a character's own fields won't list itself).

---

## Hide / Show Built-in Fields

Every character, location, and codex detail editor comes with a set of built-in fields (e.g., Fears, Belief, Atmosphere, Significance). If you don't use all of them, you can **hide** the ones you don't need to keep your editor clean.

### How to Hide a Field

1. Open any character, location, or codex detail editor.
2. **Hover** over a field label — a small **eye-off icon** (👁‍🗨) appears to the right of the label.
3. **Click the icon** — the field disappears from the form.

### How to Show Hidden Fields

1. At the bottom of each category section, a link appears: **"Show N hidden fields"**.
2. **Click the link** — the hidden fields expand in a dimmed container with a left border.
3. You can view and edit data in hidden fields while they're expanded.
4. The link text changes to **"Hide N hidden fields"** — click again to collapse.

### How to Unhide a Field

1. Expand the hidden fields using the "Show N hidden fields" link.
2. **Hover** over the hidden field's label — an **eye icon** appears.
3. **Click the eye icon** — the field is restored to its normal position permanently.

### Details

- The **Name** field can never be hidden.
- Hidden fields are stored per entity type: `character`, `location`, or the codex category ID (e.g., `items`, `creatures`). Hiding "Fears" in Characters does not affect any other view.
- **Data is never deleted.** Hiding a field only removes it from the UI. The value stays in your frontmatter unchanged and reappears when you unhide the field.
- Hidden field preferences are saved in plugin settings and persist across sessions.

---

## Tag Type Overrides

When StoryLine auto-classifies `#hashtags` or detected `[[wikilinks]]`, it may sometimes get the type wrong (e.g., classifying a prop as a location). You can manually override any tag's type:

### How to Override

1. **From the Inspector** — right-click any detected link pill in the "Detected Links" section.
2. **From the Characters View** — right-click any tag pill shown under a character's profile.
3. A context menu appears with options:
   - **Prop** — reclassify as a prop
   - **Location** — reclassify as a location
   - **Character** — reclassify as a character
   - **Other** — reclassify as unclassified
   - **Reset** — remove the override and revert to auto-classification

### Details

- Overrides are stored in plugin settings and persist across sessions.
- Overridden tags show a visual indicator (e.g., different styling) so you know they've been manually classified.
- Overrides affect both the Inspector display and the Story Graph visualization.
- `#hashtags` in **custom fields** are also scanned and can be overridden.

### Character Locations Field

The character profile includes a **Locations** field (right after Residency) for listing story locations the character appears at:

- **Residency** = where they live (static, biographical)
- **Locations** = places they go in the narrative (dynamic, plot-driven)

Values in the Locations field create character → location edges in the Story Graph. You can also use `#hashtags` inside location entries for tag-based connections.

---

## Import (Scrivener)

Import an existing Scrivener project (.scriv) as a new StoryLine project. Desktop only.

### How to Import

1. Open **Settings → Import** and click **Import .scriv**, or run **Import Scrivener Project** from the command palette.
2. Select your `.scriv` folder in the file picker.
3. If any top-level Scrivener folders don’t match a known category (Characters, Locations, Research, Notes), a **classification modal** appears asking how each should be imported:
   - **Codex category** — creates a new custom Codex category (e.g. “Magic”, “Factions”)
   - **Notes** / **Research** / **Scenes** — routes items to the corresponding StoryLine folder
   - **Skip** — excludes the folder from import
4. A new StoryLine project is created with all converted files.

### What Gets Imported

| Scrivener | StoryLine | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Draft / Manuscript folder | Scenes | RTF converted to Markdown. Part/chapter folder names written to `part` and `chapter` frontmatter. |
| Character Sketches | Characters | Synopsis → tagline, keywords → tags, custom metadata → custom fields |
| Places / Locations | Locations | Synopsis → description, keywords → tags, custom metadata → custom fields |
| Research folder | Research | Imported as research notes |
| Notes / Front Matter / Back Matter | Notes | Plain markdown notes |
| Unknown folders | User’s choice | Classification modal (see above) |
| Images & PDFs | Binary files | Copied to vault with a companion .md that embeds them |
| Labels | Tags | Scrivener label → tag |
| Status | Status | Mapped to StoryLine’s 6-stage pipeline (idea → outlined → draft → written → revised → final) |
| Custom metadata | Custom fields | Field definitions are read from the project; values written to `custom:` in frontmatter |
| Include in Compile | `compile` field | Items marked as non-compiled get `compile: false` |

### Supported Formats

- **Scrivener 3** (Mac & Windows) — fully supported
- **Scrivener 2** (Mac) / **1.9** (Windows) — supported (file layout: `Files/Docs/`)
- **Scrivener 1.x** (Mac, `binder.scrivproj` format) — **not supported**. Open the project in Scrivener 3 to convert it first.

### Tips

- The importer reads RTF files and converts formatting (bold, italic, paragraphs, Unicode). Complex RTF features like tables or embedded images within RTF are not converted.
- A summary notice shows how many scenes, characters, locations, research notes, files, and warnings were produced.
- Warnings are listed for any items that had no content file (e.g. from sync corruption or missing data).

## Custom Field Templates

Define your own reusable fields for character and location profiles. If the built-in fields don't cover everything you need, custom field templates let you add any fields you want — and they'll appear automatically in every character or location editor.

### How to Use

1. Open **Settings → Field Templates**.
2. Click **Add Field** and give it a name (e.g., "Blood Type", "Languages Spoken", "Theme Song").
3. Choose whether the field applies to **Characters**, **Locations**, or both.
4. The new field appears in every character or location detail editor under the **Custom Fields** section.
5. Fill in values per character/location as needed — empty fields are hidden from exports.

Custom field data is stored in the character or location's frontmatter under the `custom` key as key-value pairs.

---

## Image Galleries

Characters and locations support image galleries for storing reference art, concept images, maps, mood boards, or any visual material.

### Adding Images

1. Open a character or location detail editor.
2. Scroll to the **Gallery** section (below the portrait).
3. Click **Add Image** to import from your computer or choose an existing vault image.
4. Add an optional **caption** to describe each image.
5. Up to **10 images** per character or location.

### Browsing

- Use the **carousel** arrows to browse through images in the detail panel.
- Click any image to open it in a **floating lightbox**.

### Lightbox

- The lightbox is a floating window you can **drag** around and **resize**.
- **Zoom** in and out with the scroll wheel — zoom level is remembered per image.
- Navigate between gallery images using the arrow buttons.
- Close with the × button or by clicking outside.

Images are saved into the `<Project>/Images/` folder, with automatic deduplication.

## Additional Source Folders

By default, StoryLine only scans files inside your project's folder structure (Scenes, Codex/Characters, Codex/Locations, etc.). The **Additional Source Folders** feature lets you point StoryLine at any other folder in your vault so it can pick up entities stored elsewhere.

### How It Works

1. Open **Settings → Advanced**.
2. Expand the **Additional Source Folders (Experimental)** section.
3. Type or browse for a vault folder and click **Add**.
4. StoryLine recursively scans the folder and every `.md` file inside. Each file is automatically routed to the correct manager based on its frontmatter `type:` field:

| `type:` value | Routed to |
|---|---|
| `scene` | Scene Manager |
| `character` | Character Manager |
| `location` | Location Manager |
| `world` | Location Manager (as a world) |
| Any codex category id | Codex Manager |

5. Entities from additional folders appear alongside your project’s own entities in all views.

### Important Notes

- ⚠ **Experimental** — back up your files before linking external folders. Files in linked folders may be modified when you edit entities in StoryLine views.
- Works with **any folder structure** — files don’t need to be organized by type. StoryLine reads the `type:` field in each file’s frontmatter to determine what it is.
- Folder paths are **vault-relative** (e.g., `Shared Universe/Characters` or `Book 2/Scenes`).
- The folder browser provides **autocomplete** — start typing and it suggests matching vault folders.
- Remove a folder by clicking the × button next to it in the settings.
- Additional source folders are scanned after the main project folders, so project files take priority when there are duplicates.

## Project Management

StoryLine supports **multiple projects** in the same vault.

### Creating a Project
1. Command palette → **Create New StoryLine Project**.
2. Enter a project title.
3. StoryLine creates the folder structure automatically.

### Switching Projects
1. Command palette → **Open/Switch StoryLine Project**.
2. Select the project from the dropdown.

### Forking a Project
Create a copy of an existing project (useful for alternate drafts or backups):
1. Command palette → **Fork Current StoryLine Project**.
2. Enter a new title. All scenes are duplicated.

---

## Novel Covers / Project Art

Add a cover image to your project by clicking the **cover thumbnail** (or the dashed placeholder icon) in the toolbar, next to the project name. This opens the image picker where you can import an image from your computer, choose one from your vault, or remove the current cover.

Alternatively, set the `coverImage` field manually in the project frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: storyline
title: My Novel
coverImage: StoryLine/My Novel/cover.jpg
---
```

The path should be vault-relative. Once set, a small thumbnail (24 × 32 px) appears next to the project name in the toolbar selector. This works with any image format supported by Obsidian (PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG).

---

## Series Mode

Series Mode lets you group multiple book projects into a **series** with a shared Codex. Characters, locations, and any custom categories are stored once at the series level and automatically available in every book.

### Creating a Series
1. Open the project you want to use as the first book.
2. **From Settings:** Go to **Settings → Project Management** and click **Create Series…**.
   *Or from the command palette:* **Create Series from Current Project**.
3. Enter a series name.
4. StoryLine creates a series folder, moves your book into it, migrates the Codex to the series level, and writes a `series.json` manifest.

### Adding a Book to an Existing Series
1. Open the project you want to add.
2. Command palette → **Add Current Project to Series**.
3. Pick a series from the dropdown (StoryLine scans for folders containing `series.json`).
4. The book folder moves into the series folder and its Codex entries are merged into the shared Codex. Duplicate filenames are skipped.

You can also add books from the **Series Management Modal** — open it from **Settings → Project Management → Manage Series…** or the "Manage Series…" button in the Open Project modal. Each series card has an "Add book" dropdown at the bottom.

### Removing a Book from a Series
1. Open a project that belongs to a series.
2. Command palette → **Remove Current Project from Series**.
3. The shared Codex is copied into a local Codex inside the book folder, and the book moves out of the series folder.

### Renaming a Book
Go to **Settings → Project Management** and click **Rename…**. This renames the project file, its folder, updates the frontmatter title, and updates the series manifest if the book belongs to a series.

### Managing Series
Open the **Series Management Modal** from **Settings → Project Management → Manage Series…** or the "Manage Series…" button in the Open Project modal. From here you can:
- Rename a series (also renames the folder on disk).
- Reorder books within a series using the arrow buttons.
- Rename individual books.
- Add standalone books to the series.
- Remove books from the series.

### How It Works
- When a project has a `seriesId` in its frontmatter, all Codex paths (Characters, Locations, custom categories) resolve to the **series-level** Codex folder instead of the book-local one.
- All existing views — Characters, Locations, Codex Hub, Relationship Map, Story Graph, Link Scanner — work transparently with the shared Codex.
- The project selector toolbar shows a **series badge** (library icon + series name) when the active project belongs to a series.
- **Settings → Project Management** provides buttons for Rename book, Create series, and Manage series — everything is accessible without the command palette.

### Pre-flight Checks
Before any migration, StoryLine verifies that Obsidian's **"Automatically update internal links"** setting is enabled. This ensures all `[[wikilinks]]` remain valid when files move between folders. If the setting is off, the migration is blocked with a notice.

### Series Folder Layout
```
StoryLine/
  My Series/
    series.json              ← Series manifest (name, book order)
    Codex/                   ← Shared across all books
      Characters/
      Locations/
      [Custom]/
    Book One.md
    Book One/
      Scenes/
      System/
    Book Two.md
    Book Two/
      Scenes/
      System/
```

> **Rule:** A solo book has a local Codex. A series book uses the series Codex. A book never has both.

## File Structure

StoryLine organizes your vault like this:

```
YourVault/
  StoryLine/                      ← Root folder (configurable)
    My Novel.md                   ← Project file
    My Novel/                     ← Project folder
      Scenes/                     ← Scene files (Markdown with frontmatter)
        01 - The Beginning.md
        02 - The Chase.md
        ...
      Codex/                      ← Codex hub folder
        Characters/               ← Character profiles (Markdown with frontmatter)
        Locations/                ← Location & world profiles
          Eryndor.md              ← World file
          Eryndor/                ← Locations in this world
            The Iron Citadel.md
            Port Veyra.md
        Props/                    ← Example custom category
        Factions/                 ← Example custom category
      System/                     ← Per-project settings (auto-managed)
        settings.json             ← Tag colors, aliases, overrides
        plotgrid.json             ← Plotgrid layout data
        board.json                ← Corkboard positions
        tracker.json              ← Writing tracker history
      Exports/                    ← Exported files (MD, JSON, CSV, HTML, PDF, DOCX)
    Another Book.md               ← Another project
    Another Book/
      Scenes/
      ...
```

Existing projects with Characters and Locations at the top level (outside Codex/) continue to work — StoryLine detects the old layout automatically.

Scene files are standard Markdown — you can edit them directly in Obsidian's editor, and StoryLine reads the frontmatter automatically.

## Tips & Workflow

1. **Start with the Board View** — create scenes as ideas, then outline and draft them.
2. **Use acts and chapters** to structure your story. Add empty act/chapter columns from the Board toolbar so you can see gaps.
3. **Apply a beat sheet** — use Save the Cat, 3-Act, or Hero's Journey templates for instant structure scaffolding.
4. **Tag your plotlines** — assign tags like `romance`, `mystery`, `character-arc` to track storylines across the Plotlines View. Assign colors to tags for instant visual identification.
5. **Set up POV and characters** early — the Characters View and Relationship Map become more useful as you add character metadata.
6. **Use the intensity field** (-10 to +10) to plan your emotional arc. The Stats View graphs this as a tension curve.
7. **Use chronological order** if your story has flashbacks or non-linear timelines. Toggle between reading and chronological order in the Timeline View.
17. **Set timeline modes** for non-linear scenes — flashbacks, dreams, parallel timelines, etc. This suppresses false plot-hole warnings and adds visual badges.
8. **Check Stats regularly** — the plot hole detector and pacing analysis catch structural issues early.
9. **Save filter presets** for your common views (e.g., "Act 1 only", "Unfinished scenes", "Anna's POV").
10. **Use scene notes** for editorial comments — they export with your outline but stay separate from manuscript text.
11. **Save snapshots** before major rewrites — you can always restore a previous version.
12. **Export outlines** to share with beta readers or editors without sharing your vault. CSV exports open directly in Excel/Sheets.
13. **Use `Ctrl+Z`** freely — undo tracks all scene changes within the session.
14. **Use writing sprints** to stay focused — the built-in timer in Stats View keeps you on track.
15. **Scene content is just Markdown** — use headings, links, callouts, and any Obsidian feature inside your scenes.
16. **Enable swimlanes** in the Timeline for a bird's-eye view of parallel storylines by POV, location, or tag.
