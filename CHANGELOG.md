# StoryLine — Changelog

---

## Version 1.5.0

### New Features

- **Codex Hub** — Characters and Locations now live inside a unified **Codex** view with tab-based navigation. Add your own custom categories (e.g., Props, Factions, Magic Systems) — each category gets its own folder, search, and detail pages. The Codex replaces the separate Characters and Locations tabs with a single, extensible hub.

- **Plotgrid Auto-Note** — Typing into an empty, unlinked Plotgrid cell now automatically creates a corkboard note and links it back to the cell. The note is created as an *idea* with a plotgrid-origin label (row / column) for easy tracking. Enabled by default; toggle on or off from the Plotgrid toolbar.

### Design Overhaul

The entire UI has been refined for a cleaner, less cluttered look:

- **Minimal tab navigation** — View mode toggles (Corkboard/Kanban, List/Subway, Grid/Map/Story Graph) now use a clean underline-tab style instead of bordered buttons.
- **Icon-only action buttons** — "New Character", "New World", and "New Location" buttons have been replaced with compact icon-only buttons with tooltips, freeing up toolbar space.
- **Streamlined toolbars** — Toolbar gaps and spacing have been tightened across all views for a more compact layout. 

### Improvements

- **Codex folder structure** — New projects now store Characters and Locations inside a `Codex/` folder. Existing projects with the old folder layout are detected and work without changes.
- **Codex search** — The Codex hub search now includes Characters, Locations, and any custom categories in its results.

### Bug Fixes

- **YAML frontmatter corruption** — Fixed an issue where invisible characters (zero-width non-joiners, byte order marks) could be inserted into frontmatter, breaking YAML parsing. All frontmatter is now sanitized on read and write.
- **Kanban rubber-banding** — Fixed an issue where Kanban columns could snap back after dragging if the underlying data hadn't finished saving.
- **Relationship Map scaling** — Fixed a rendering issue where the relationship map could appear at the wrong scale after switching views.
- **Story Graph scaling** — Fixed a similar scaling issue in the story graph visualization.
- **Location portrait layout** — Location detail portraits are now styled consistently with character portraits.
- **Codex hub category reset** — Fixed the category tabs sometimes resetting to the first tab when switching back to the hub.
- **Plotgrid left padding** — Fixed the first column in the Plot Grid being too close to the edge.

## Version 1.4.0

### New Features

- **Custom Field Templates** — Define your own reusable fields for character and location profiles. Add any fields you need beyond the built-in ones and they'll appear in every character or location editor.

- **Image Gallery** — Characters and locations now support a full image gallery (up to 10 images each) with a carousel, editable captions, and a floating lightbox viewer you can resize and drag around. Great for reference art, concept images, or mood boards.

- **Resizable Text Blocks** — All text fields in character and location detail views can now be resized by dragging the corner. No more squinting at tiny boxes.

- **Autocomplete & Tag Inputs** — Character, location, and tag fields now use autocomplete with a tag-pill style instead of plain text inputs. Start typing and pick from existing entries.

- **Chapter Titles & Descriptions** — Acts and chapters can now have descriptions in addition to labels. Right-click any act or chapter column header in the Board view and choose "Edit Description" to add notes about that section of your story. Descriptions appear as subtitles under column headers.

### Plotgrid Improvements

- **Act & Chapter Dividers** — The grid now shows colored divider bands when the act or chapter changes, with labels from your project structure. Makes it easy to see where story sections begin and end.

- **Status Color-Coding** — Scene rows show a colored left border matching their status (idea, outlined, draft, written, revised, final) so you can see progress at a glance.

- **Click to Open Files** — Click any scene row header to open its file. Click a column header to open the character or location file. Quick way to jump to your notes while working in the grid.

- **Shared Filters** — The Plotgrid now uses the same filter bar as the Board and Timeline views. Filter by status, act, chapter, POV, characters, locations, tags, or search text. Presets are shared across all views.

- **Tabbed Cell Inspector** — When a cell has a linked scene, the inspector panel now shows two tabs: **Cell** (cell content, detected links, and scan results) and **Scene** (the full scene editor with all fields). Switch between them to edit cell notes or scene details without leaving the grid.

### Improvements

- **Files open in preview mode** — Clicking to open a scene, character, or location file from anywhere in StoryLine now opens it in reading view by default, keeping frontmatter out of sight.

### Bug Fixes

- **POV dropdown staying open** — Fixed an issue where the POV autocomplete dropdown would keep reopening after being dismissed on empty fields.

- **Autocomplete cleanup** — Fixed a memory issue where autocomplete dropdowns weren't being properly cleaned up when fields were re-rendered.

## Version 1.3.2

### New Features

- **Story Navigator** — A compact sidebar panel for quick scene navigation. Search and filter scenes by title, sort by five modes (sequence, status, recent, words, title), filter by plotline with color-coded dots and scene counts, group by act with collapsible sections, pin scenes for quick access, and track progress with a bottom bar. Auto-opens when a project loads (configurable in settings) or via the command palette.

- **Sticky Note Themes** — Six built-in color themes for corkboard sticky notes: Classic, Pastel, Earth, Jewel, Neon, and Mono. Each provides 14 colors. Includes HSL sliders (hue shift, saturation, lightness) for fine-tuning and per-note color overrides via right-click.

- **Plotline HSL Sliders** — Fine-tune your entire plotline color palette with hue shift, saturation, and lightness sliders. Real-time swatch preview. Adjustments stack on top of the active scheme and per-tag overrides.

- **Per-Project Color Overrides** — Optionally save color scheme, HSL adjustments, and sticky note theme per project. Toggle "Use project-specific colors" in settings so each book can have its own look. Settings are stored in the project's `System/plotlines.json` and load automatically when switching projects.

### Improvements

- **Corkboard smoothness** — Improved drag performance with `requestAnimationFrame`, added inertia on release, and smoother zoom transitions.

- 

### Bug Fixes

- **Scene split placement** — Split scene now correctly preserves the sequence number for the first half instead of overwriting it. It also places the second split half under the first instead of at the end.

## Version 1.3.1

Version 1.3.1 fixes:

**Cascade Rename**
Renaming a character or location now updates all references across the project, with a confirmation modal.

**PlotGrid Editing**
Inspector textarea edits no longer get wiped by grid re-renders. Headers are also protected while editing.

**Family/Background Field**
Moved from "Basic Information" to the "Relationships" section in character view.

**Character Tagline Setting**
New setting to choose which field appears as the tagline on character cards.

**Scene Deselect on Save**
Selected scene stays selected after saving/refreshing in Board and Timeline views.

**Scene Rename in Inspector**
Editing a scene title in the inspector no longer causes the inspector to re-render mid-typing.

**Larger Textareas**
Description and Conflict fields increased from 4/2 rows to 12 rows each.
*Note that right clicking on a scene and choosing edit will open the scene and you can type as much as you like.*

**Split Scene Fix**
Split no longer deletes the first half. The split button was accidentally calling the delete handler instead of a refresh.

**More options for Location types.**

## Version 1.3.0

> **⚠️ Important — Back up your StoryLine folder before updating!**
> 
> This release includes a one-time automatic migration that moves per-project settings out of the shared `data.json` file and into individual `System/` files inside each project folder. This is a necessary change to make StoryLine work reliably across multiple devices (desktop, mobile, sync services).
> 
> The migration runs automatically on first launch and should be seamless, but as a precaution, **please make a copy of your entire `StoryLine/` folder** before installing version 1.3.0 — just in case something goes wrong.

### New Features

- **Corkboard View** — A new freeform corkboard layout in the Board view. Use sticky notes to brainstorm and capture your first ideas, then convert them into scenes when they're ready. Notes can be styled with different colors and support markdown. Pin notes and scene cards anywhere on a spatial canvas and drag them to rearrange. Toggle between the standard column layout Kanban and corkboard mode with a single click. Positions are saved per project.

- **DOCX Export** — Export your manuscript or outline as a `.docx` Word document, ready for editors, agents, or print formatting. Includes its own settings for page size, margins, font, and header styles. Works also on mobile.

- **PDF Export** — Export your project directly to PDF with styled formatting and section headers. Works on desktop via the built-in print engine. PDF export only works on desktop.

- **HTML Export** — Full HTML export with embedded styles for sharing or archiving your project as a standalone web page.

- **Browse for Project** — A new "Browse for Project…" button in the project selector lets you manually find and open any StoryLine project in your vault, including deeply nested series projects. Useful when projects aren't detected automatically (e.g. on mobile or after a fresh sync).

### Improvements

- **System file architecture** — Per-project data (tag colors, character aliases, plotgrid layout, corkboard positions, writing tracker history, filter presets) is now stored in `System/` JSON files inside each project folder instead of the shared plugin `data.json`. This eliminates sync conflicts when working across multiple devices and keeps project data portable.

- **Automatic migration** — On first launch, existing per-project data is automatically migrated from `data.json` to the new `System/` files. No manual steps required.

- **Project detection retry** — If no projects are found on startup (common on mobile where the file system may load slowly), StoryLine now retries up to three times with increasing delays before showing the project selector.

- **Recursive project scanning** — Project detection now scans subfolders recursively, so series projects nested several levels deep (e.g. `StoryLine/My Series/Book 1/Book 1.md`) are found automatically.

- **Default view setting** — Choose which view opens by default when launching StoryLine. Set your preferred starting view (Board, Timeline, Characters, etc.) in the plugin settings.

### Bug Fixes

- **Dropdown background fix** — Fixed a visual bug where dropdown menus (status, POV, filters) had transparent or incorrectly themed backgrounds, making them hard to read in certain themes.

- **Corkboard positions no longer stored in frontmatter** — Board positions are now saved in `System/board.json` instead of the project file's YAML frontmatter, preventing unnecessary file changes and sync noise.

- **Feature flags preserved during migration** — Global settings like series mode and export toggles are no longer accidentally removed when migrating per-project data.

- **Migration timing fix** — Resolved a race condition where settings could be saved before migration data was fully loaded into memory, which previously caused tag overrides and other project data to be lost.
